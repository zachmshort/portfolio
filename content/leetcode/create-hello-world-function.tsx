      <p>
        This is about as straight forward as it gets in my opinion. It was the
        one of the first leetcode problems I attempted and solved. However, I
        did overthink it in hindsight and submitted the incorrect answer roughly
        5 times. Create Hello World Function is a great display of simple is
        better.
